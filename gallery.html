          <p class="changeable-text"> Rain forest is simply an area of tall, mostly evergreen trees and a high amount of
            rainfall.
            Sri Lanka is gifted with a rain forest where it is considered as a wonder of the world.
            Rain forests are the Earth s oldest living eco systems and Sinharaja forest is one of the greatest things
            that Sri Lankans have.
            It is our duty to protect this wonder of the world.

          <h1 class="changeable-text">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
          <p class="changeable-text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
            Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
            galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

          <h1 class="changeable-text">Where does it come from?</h1>
          <p class="changeable-text">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in
            a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
            professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
            from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
            undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
            ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
